Changelog for CMFFormController

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

CMFFormController 2.0 - unreleased

    - Changed exportimport module to a package, added some interfaces
      and configure.zcml in order to register separate import / export
      handlers for .vpy and .cpy, since snapshot exports were breaking
      when these were handled like default .py files
      [RaFromBRC]
