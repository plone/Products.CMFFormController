2003-03-09  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Cleaned up the example code, release 1.0!

2003-03-05  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Got rid of some spurious warnings about "Unknown context type" when 
     installing new templates with .metadata specifying actions/validators for 
     all types.

2003-03-03  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Fix default scripts

2003-03-03  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Minor cleanup, release RC3.

2003-03-02  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Fixes for 2773 (handling of image buttons) and 2779 (xml import problems)

2003-01-30  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Minor cleanup, release RC2.

2004-01-16  Jim Roepcke <jim@roepcke.com> (jimroepcke)

   * Remove acquisition wrappers from keys and values before putting them in
     the action and validator containers.

2003-12-19  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Moved warning for actions / validators with unknown context types to
     ControllerBase so that it is invoked only when metadata files are loaded.

2003-12-16  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Added more descriptive error message for "No controller state available"

   * Added license.

2003-12-03  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Changed exception for actions / validators with unknown context types to
     a warning, since there appear to be times at which the complete list of
     types is unavailable (e.g. during site copying / moving)

2003-12-02  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Strip acquisition layers from actions and validators before doing
     ZODB clone

2003-11-12  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * FormController.py: Fixed bug in addFormValidators (thanks alienoid)

   * Added code to report file in which metadata errors occur.

2003-10-29  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Fixed code that tests for existence of validators and objects being 
     traversed to.  You'll get a helpful ValueError now instead of a cryptic
     Unauthorized exception when things aren't found.

   * Dump the full file name to the log when a .metadata file's [actions] or
     [validators] sections can't be read properly.

   * Fixed the version number.  D'oh.

2003-10-25  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Fixed validation for scripts so that it will work when scripts are called
     programmatically and/or from unit tests (e.g. without a REQUEST)

   * Added missing initial self.validators and self.actions to 
     ControllerPythonScripts

2003-10-24  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Modified the getError/setError methods in FormControllerState to be more
     tolerant of non-i18ned error messages.

   * Updated info about CMF 1.3 installation thanks to more info from Laurent
     Mallet (Ellis).

   * Documented CallProfiler patch (thanks to Andy McKay = andym)

   * Added patch to make debugging work properly in Wing IDE (may require
     patches to CMFCore, too).  Thanks to Stephan Deibel.

2003-10-23  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Laurent Mallet informs me that to make CMFFormController work with CMF 1.3.x,
     you need to copy FSPythonScript from CMF 1.4.x's CMFCore directory to
     CMF 1.3.x's CMFCore directlry.  Updated README.txt

2003-10-21  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Added better error handling for validation.  Make sure validators are
     really CMFFormController validators (weird things happen if not), make sure
     validators can be found.

2003-10-20  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Added nicer methods for programmatically adding actions and validators

2003-10-18  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Improved error handling for errors in traverse_to

2003-10-17  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Added documentation into ZMI tab

   * Moved documentation text on ZMI forms to reduce need to scroll

2003-10-15  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Fixed metadata type for Controller Validators

   * Added validators and UI for validators to python scripts

2003-10-08  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Added a missing import to Script.py

   * Fixed the way redirect actions handle items in the query string.  There may
     still be problems with anchors in the redirect -- need to check on this.

2003-10-07  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Added more detailed error messages when next action can't be found.
     Hopefully this will make people less mystified when they screw up
     their .metadata files.

2003-09-27  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Bound the state to the global variable 'state' in controller scripts and
     validators.  One less line of code to write!

2003-09-27  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Added a forgotten import statement in ControllerPythonScript

   * ControllerValidators don't use actions or validators so the actions tab has
     been removed

   * Fixed the customize function so that it copies actions and validators when
     you customize an FSControllerPageTemplate or an FSControllerPythonScript

2003-09-23  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Renamed classes (ControlledX to ControllerX)

   * Created separate ControllerValidator and FSControllerValidator classes

   * Made new defaults for ControllerValidator and for ControllerPythonScript classes

2003-08-17  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Modified the validation of validators in FormValidator to allow for
     validators in which a directory path is specified.

2003-08-08  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Modified the way that ControllerState objects store the context.  For 
     reasons I don't completely understand, the old way I was storing them
     trashed the stored object's acquisition context (even when they were
     properly unwrapped via aq_inner).  The fix is kind of evil: I store the
     context in a list, so the acquisition context is unchanged by the 
     container.  This will wreak havoc if we ever try to persist ControllerState
     objects, but this shouldn't have to happen, since we just pass around the 
     state objects in the REQUEST.

   * Added a default.html file that has some useful default content for 
     ControlledPageTemplates that are created in the ZMI.
    
2003-08-06  Kevin Teague <kevin@bud.ca> (Wheat)

   * Minor corrections and edits to the documentation within the ZMI Validation
     and Actions tabs. Added an example of setting portal_status_message from a 
     script using state.setKwargs() in the docs.

2003-08-01  Kevin Teague <kevin@bud.ca> (Wheat)

   * Updated the documentation to reflect the new .metadata file method.

2003-07-30  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Things now work if the validators section of the .metadata file is empty.
     Also fixed problem with ControlledPageTemplateFile not getting the right
     path to the .metadata file.

2003-07-30  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Added instructions for making CMFFormController work with CMF 1.3 to the
     README file.

2003-07-30  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * .metadata files didn't load properly if they didn't contain both an actions
     section and a validators section.  Fixed.

2003-07-30 Kevin Teague <kevin@bud.ca> (Wheat)

   * Prettied up the ZMI tables for Default Actions and Default Validators

2003-07-27  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

    * Complete refactoring.  Default properties are now specified in .metadata
      files when appropriate.

2003-07-04  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

    * Initial check-in
