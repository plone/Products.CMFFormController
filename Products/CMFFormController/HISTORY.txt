    (name of developer listed in brackets)

CMFFormController 2.1.1 - Released October 7, 2007

    - Removed two __traceback_info__'s from ControllerBase which where both
      causing too much speed cost and optimized some Acquisition handling.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed #7027 : ControllerState.__str__ loaded files in memory
      [zegor]

    - Made tests pass without Plone being installed.
      [hannosch]

CMFFormController 2.1 - Released August 9, 2007

    - No changes.
      [hannosch]

CMFFormController 2.1rc1 - Released July 9, 2007

   - Removed utility registration - the formcontroller tool uses self.REQUEST
     which is not available in utilities.
     [wichert[

CMFFormController 2.1b4 - Released May 5, 2007

    - Removed five:registerPackage again, as it is causing problems in ZEO
      environments.
      [hannosch]

CMFFormController 2.1b3 - Released May 1, 2007

    - Back to getToolByName we go.
      [wichert]

CMFFormController 2.1b2 - Released March 23, 2007

    - Converted installation code to be based on a GenericSetup extension
      profile.
      [hannosch]

    - Let the form controller tool implement and interface and added a bbb
      registerToolInterface call.
      [hannosch]

    - Replaced getToolByName by getUtility calls.
      [hannosch]

CMFFormController 2.1b1 - Released March 5, 2007

    - Converted to a regular Python package in the Products namespace.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed deprecation warnings for minimalpath and expandpath methods. These
      weren't needed at all anymore, as the stored filepath is absolut anyways.
      [hannosch]

    - Removed all occurrences of portal_status_message.
      [hannosch]

CMFFormController 2.0.7 - Released January 27, 2006

    - Fixed the combineArgs method of BaseFormAction to decode Unicode values
      in the query string to a defined encoding. You can specify this encoding
      in config.py and it defaults to utf-8.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed the import of XML files where the context_type/button attributes
      are missing. It's not exported when the value is None, which means any
      button or any content-type.
      [deo]

CMFFormController 2.0.6 - Released November 4, 2006

    - General code cleaned, removed unused imports.
      [hannosch]

    - Converted log functions to use the logging package instead of zLOG.
      [hannosch]

CMFFormController 2.0.5 - Released September 8, 2006

    - Modernized type checking to use isinstance() instead of type() as the
      latter does not recognize derived types. As an example checking for
      UnicodeType or unicode with type() does not recognize Zope3 Messages,
      which are derived from unicode. Usually for checking for stringish types
      you want to do isinstance(foo, basestring) nowadays. This fixes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5741.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed some deprecation warnings for CompilerError.
      [hannosch]

    - Cleaned up test infrastructure, removed custom testrunner.
      [hannosch]

CMFFormController 2.0.4 - Released June 17, 2006

    - Fix issue with usage of relative urls for action traversal, rather than
      actual physical paths, which are necessary.
      [alecm]

CMFFormController 2.0.3 - Released June 9, 2006

    - Fix issue with redirecting/traversing to FTI actions which are defined
      in the folder category. Also, made action traversal/redirection less
      error prone.
      [alecm]

CMFFormController 2.0.2 - Released May 15, 2006

    - Only export ZODB controller scripts and validators, not FS versions.
      [rafrombrc]

    - Changed exportimport handlers to depend on GenericSetup directly instead
      of the soon to be removed CMFSetup.
      [hannosch]

    - RedirectToActions call to getActionObject on objects would always fail.
      Fixed http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5446.
      [regebro]

    - Avoid DeprecationWarning for manageAddDelete.
      [hannosch]

    - Update tests to comply with PloneTestCase 0.8 API.
      [hannosch]

CMFFormController 2.0.1 - Released March 28, 2006

    - Fix method alias lookup on TraverseToAction, so that the conversion of
      urls to aliases doesn't cause empty pages to be returned. Remove the alias
      lookup on RedirectToAction because it is entirely unnecessary and
      counter-intuitive. Removed some useless print statements.
      [alecm]

    - Fix two typos in documentation.
      [vinsci]

    - Shut down DeprecationWarning for product_name of ToolInit.
      [hannosch]

CMFFormController 2.0 - Released February 25, 2006

    - Moved xml folder into exportimport module, as tests were expecting it in
      this location.
      [hannosch]

    - Changed exportimport module to a package, added some interfaces
      and configure.zcml in order to register separate import / export
      handlers for .vpy and .cpy, since snapshot exports were breaking
      when these were handled like default .py files
      [RaFromBRC]

    - renamed importexport.py to exportimport.py
      [RaFromBRC]

    - Added importexport.py for CMFSetup
      [plonista]

    - Moved to new ZODB transaction API, fixed import locations of
      format_stx and expandPath
      [hannosch]

CMFFormController 1.0.7 - Released December 18, 2005

    - Correct some wrong security settings.
      [hannosch]

    - Made tests compatible with Zope 2.9 (transaction module)
      [hannosch]

CMFFormController 1.0.6 - Released October 9, 2005
